# Using hkupop-legco spss datasets

* Purpose

    A personal study on the hkupopy web site contained Legco exit-poll and rolling survey results.

    I personally do not recommend to use csv.  But they said they have that format (which I do not bother to find it out.)

* Source

    The data come from : https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/resources/dataset/lc/index.html

* Disclaimer and License

    I have no relationship with the programme or HKU related to this programme.  There is no gurantee or expectataion of any correctness etc. on itis analysis.

    For the copyright of the data, you have to refer to hkupop.  I just heard today (9 July 2016 in a seminar) from Mr Robert Chung they release the data for pubic use but do not mention the license.  You can search for that web site for that information.

* How to use the data

    -   I will try R later, but as Mr Chung has said about PSPP (and the dataset format is in SPSS .dat), I would try this first

* PSPP way
